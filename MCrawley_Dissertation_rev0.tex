% It is better to break up the dissertation into multiple files (e.g.,
% one file per chapter, as well as separate files for the abstract,
% acknowledgements, and vita).  These files are brought into the
% document using \include{} statements.  There will be times, however,
% when you don't want to print the ENTIRE dissertation.  You can limit
% what will actually be printed by using the \includeonly{} statment.
% This contains a list of the files you want printed.  Any file NOT
% listed will not be printed.  However, all page numbers, references,
% etc., will be preserved as though all the files were actually
% printed. For example, the line below would result only in chapters 1
% and 3 being printed (if it were uncommented).

%\includeonly{ch_introduction}

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  In the newest format, titles should be title case everywhere.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  In the new format, the titles of each chapter should appear in
%  uppercase.  In the TOC, however, they should be in lowercase.
%  The command below automates this behavior.  However, you'll have to be
%  careful not to include \labels within your \chapter definitions or
%  there will be problems.  If you don't want this to be automated, comment
%  out the \typesetChapterTitle definition below and do your chapters in
%  the form:
%  \chapter[MY TITLE]{My Title}
%
%  \renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{\uppercase{#1}}
\renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{#1}
