\chapter{Conclusions}
The aeroacoustic mechanisms in high-speed, turbulent jets were investigated using simultaneous pressure and velocity measurements of large-scale structures generated by plasma excitation.
As the focus of this work was on mixing noise generated by turbulent shear layer structures common to all flow regimes, rather than acoustic emission generated by supersonic flow phenomena, an unheated, Mach 0.9 jet was used.
In the current work, only structures of azimuthal mode zero (axisymmetric ring vortices) were investigated. Previous researchers have identified the axisymmetric mode as the dominant acoustic emission pattern, and this also served to simplify the data acquisition and analysis greatly by eliminating the need to obtain azimuthal velocity components and gradients.

To begin with, the irrotational near-field pressure was linearly decomposed into it's constitutive hydrodynamic and acoustic components, akin to the work of previous researchers \citep{Tinney2008}.
Here though, the pressure was filtered via a two-dimensional, spatio-temporal wavelet transform, which was found to be more robust than the Fourier transform used previously.
Once decomposed, linear correlations between the far-field acoustic signal at $30^\circ$ and the acoustic component of the near-field were computed in order to identify the dominant acoustic source region in the jet based on the measured time-lag for the peak correlation.
In all cases, natural and excited jets, the dominant acoustic source region was found to comprise the upstream region of the jet and end at $z/D \simeq 4$, just upstream of the end of the potential core.
This result is in general accordance with previous results acquired at the GDTL by Hileman \etal \citep{Hileman2005}, which identified the acoustic source region using delay-and-sum beamforming with a circular microphone array in the acoustic near-field (that is, far enough such that hydrodynamic pressure effects are negligible, but not in the true geometric far-field of the jet).
In that work, the dominant acoustic source region for an unheated, Mach 1.3 jet was found to be located just downstream of the end of the potential core, and was related to the breakup of large-scale coherent structures as they passed through this region.

The evolution, interactions, and, disintegration of the large-scale structures induced by the plasma excitation were then studied by stochastically-estimating the time-resolved velocity fields from temporally-correlated velocity snapshots and near-field pressure traces.
The velocity snapshots were first decomposed into orthogonal modes and expansion coefficients per Sirovich's method of snapshots for proper orthogonal decomposition \citep{Sirovich1987}.
A mapping from the near-field pressure to the POD expansion coefficients was generated by a standard feedforward, backpropagating neural network; from this mapping the time-resolved expansion coefficients could be estimated and thus a reduced-order, time-resolved estimate of the velocity field produced.
At very low excitation frequencies (impulsive excitation) each plasma pulse generates a single dominant structure, which initially grows rapidly as it convects downstream. 
As the structure nears the end of the potential core, $z/D \simeq 4$, a rapid disintegration of the vortex is observed, coincident with a strong axial acceleration.
As the excitation frequency is increased, a much more complex structure evolution takes form.
At moderate excitation frequencies (periodic forcing), multiple structures are initially formed by the plasma pulse; these quickly merge to form periodic structures which match the excitation frequency.
These structures later undergo a rapid disintegration and acceleration, similar to the impulsive excitation structures, as the convect downstream near the end of the potential core. 

Finally, the aeroacoustic sources were estimated from the time-resolved velocity fields using Ribner's simplified form of Lighthill's acoustic analogy, which relates fluctuations in the dilatation field to fluctuations in the acoustic field.
This required numerous simplifications to the governing equations, which ultimately degraded the accuracy of the computed aeroacoustic source field.
Unfortunately, this limited interpretation of the results, as the computed far-field acoustic signal did not match well with the measured signal.
It had been hoped that high-resolution velocity fields and nonlinear estimation methods would be sufficient for overcoming the challenges inherent in measuring acoustic source fields in high-speed, turbulent jets, but clearly this was not the case. 
An experimentalist can always dream, though.

Perhaps the greatest deficiency in the current work was the reliance on linear correlations from the acoustic component of the near-field to the far-field.
This was done because two-point correlations are quick, simple, and their use is well-established in the literature.
However, this overlooks the great advancements in acoustic holography that have occurred in the last several decades.
Though the linear array of microphones used in this work is not well-optimized for acoustic beamforming, additional information on the noise source characteristics, such as directivity or frequency content, can likely be gleaned from the decomposed irrotational near-field using a number of beamforming algorithms of varying complexity.
