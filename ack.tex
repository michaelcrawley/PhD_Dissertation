First and foremost I would like to thank my adviser, Prof. Mo Samimy, for providing me with this great opportunity to develop my research capabilities under his guidance, and for surrounding me with such a fantastic group of coworkers during my time at the Gas Dynamics and Turbulence Laboratory.
Though they all helped me in their own way, I would like to specifically thank Drs. Aniruddha Sinha, Nathan Webb, Christopher Clifford, and Rachelle Speth for the wealth of knowledge and experience they shared with me, and for their friendship.
I'd like to acknowledge Prof. Datta Gaitonde and his laboratory for their aid on all things computational.
Special thanks goes to Jeff Barton, for his great help debugging, shielding, and isolating the electrical systems throughout the laboratory, and for accepting even the most vague assurances that he would be financially compensated for his work. 
I'd like to thank Prof. Roberto Camussi for inviting me to visit his laboratory at the Universit\`{a} degli Studi Roma Tre; the work I did there became the basis for the fourth chapter of this dissertation.
Lastly, I would also like to thank his student, Lior Gefen, for his help with my experimental setup and understanding the ins-and-outs of wavelet transforms and stochastic estimation.
